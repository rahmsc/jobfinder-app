My first experimentation with designing a mobile app using Expo and React Native.

It's a simple job finder app, that uses JSearch Rapid API to find available jobs, their descriptions, qualification and requirements, plus allowing you to follow a link to apply straight through the app
# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router
```
